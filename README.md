# Abstract
The main aim of this report is to provide a detailed conceptual analysis of the mission to launch a satellite from the earth to the moon and let it crashed into and the moon. This allows the formation of a dust cloud, which can then be analyzed by other satellites.

The satellite is first placed into its initial orbit, Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) by Ariane V launch vehicle. The satellite is then launched to points where the planes of the orbit of the moon and satellite intersect. This allows the satellite hits the moon without changing the plane of the satelliteʼs orbit. This is desirable because a powerful and expensive propulsion system is required to change the plane of orbit.

In a bid to accomplish this mission, the satellite is required to impact the moon with a high velocity, thus allowing the generation of light flash, ejecta plumes and dust cloud, which will be further analyzed by other satellites. Hence, the points in GTO where the satellite can be launched to impact the moon, the position of the impact point, the launching velocity and time required, and the impact velocity are determined in this report.

# Introduction
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been leading a significant role in space research and numerous valuable researches have been conducted to provide more knowledge on space, planets, and starts.

After the Apollo missions, NASA has not been able to make much prominent progress on discovering further properties of the moon. Furthermore, due to the extravagant cost of Apollo missions, NASA has only been able to make analysis through the observation of the moon surface through satellites and telescopes. The search for new methods is urged.

Recently, scientists have come up with a novel idea to study the surface of the moon. The idea originated from the highly successful ʻDeep Impactʼ mission on July 4, 2005. A spacecraft was crashed into Comet 9P/Tempel 1. The ejecta plumes were monitored by space- and Earth-based telescopes to provide valuable information concerning the composition of comets. A similar idea can be used to obtain information of the composition of the moon and the presence of water.
This project is inspired by the existing NASA project, Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS), which successfully crashed the moon and obtained valuable discoveries, including the detection of the presence of water on the moon. Brown University Professor Schultz was the proposer of this project.

The main purpose of this project is to obtain various design parameters for the mission to be possible under the current space industry technology. The satellite is first placed into an initial orbit around the earth and it is fired at a pre-selected point on the orbit to place the satellite on a predetermined trajectory to hit the moon. Since the planes of the orbit of the moon and of the satellite are not the same, it is crucial to shoot the satellite at the designated point and velocity so that it can hit the moon at the point where both planes intersect as changing the plane of the satelliteʼs orbit requires a huge amount of energy.

In this report, a step-by-step analysis about how the satellite can hit the moon is conducted. This includes putting the satellite in Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO), determining the points where the orbits of moon and satellite are in the same plane, the critical velocity required to put the satellite into the appropriate trajectory for it to collide with the moon and the time when the moon reaches the collision point. Any miscalculation will lead to failure of the mission.
At the end of the analysis, the trajectory of the satellite to the moon from the perigee of the satellite orbit, the critical thrusting velocity, point of impact and the impact velocity are found. With the results found, the satellite should successfully crash into the moon.
